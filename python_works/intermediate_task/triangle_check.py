# the sum of two side lengths of a triangle is always greater than the third side

# Equilateral triangle. The Equilateral triangle shown on the left has three congruent sides and three congruent angles. Each angle is 60Â°.
# Isosceles triangle. The Isosceles triangle shown on the left has two equal sides and two equal angles.
# Scalene Triangle. The Scalene Triangle has no congruent sides. In other words, each side must have a different length.
