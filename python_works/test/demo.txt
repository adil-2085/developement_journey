hi all my name is pradyod s babu...here im going to give a brief summary about the video of dhanish dhamani where he tell us about how he overcame the fear of public speaking.

in the video.....he starts by telling about his childhood incident where his teacher told him give a self intro in front of his class..but he was so afraid that he couldn't say a single word....years gone by...he overcame so many of few childhood fears but still he couldn't get rid of the fear of public speaking....

then he researched google to overcame his fear where he got so many ideas and inspirations that can make him a better person personally and professionally...he started practicing by speaking infront of mirror and participating in public speaking club......which made him better in public speaking .... it also made him think that there might be a way to become even better.. then he again researched google where learned more about AI which he belived that AI could be our speech coachs..he imagined a world where anyone has the help of AI to help them overcame this fear...this idea helped him and his friend to create an App called OraAI which uses AI to improve our speaking ability...As the moral of his life story...he tells us to face our fears..look for solutions if solutions are not found...make solutions...
